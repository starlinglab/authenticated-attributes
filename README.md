# Authenticated Attributes

This repo contains the initial implementation of the Authenticated Attributes project from The Starling Lab. It is built on top of the [Hyperbee](https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hyperbee) key-value store.

## Development

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies. Enable pre-commit hooks with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Now you should be ready to make code changes, and formatting and linting will happen automatically before committing.

Using NodeJS v20 LTS is recommended over the latest NodeJS version.

## Documentation

Please see the [docs](./docs/) folder for further documentation on the project. [database.md](./docs/database.md) is a good starting point.
